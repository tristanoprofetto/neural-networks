# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)

RNN's are a special form of neural networks which leverage their "memory" property in order allow previous outputs to be used as sequential inputs throughout the hidden layers. Thanks to the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm, RNN's can have their weights optimized in way of best handling sequential data such as; text and time-series.
