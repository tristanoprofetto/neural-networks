# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's)

### Basic Features
CNN's are a type of neural network architecture optimized for tackling Computer Vision tasks. 

The architecture of CNN's is designed to better handle image data, and since its inception has driven the AI driven applications over the last decade. The design goal of CNN's was to create a network architecture where the neurons in the early layers of the network would extract local visual features (convolutional layers), and neurons in later layers would combine these features to form higher-order features (fully-connected layers).

### CNN Architecture
There are several types of CNN architectures that are optimized for different computer vision tasks, but generally speaking they will contain the following layers...
* Input Layer
* Covolutional Layer: application of a filter to the input that results in a feature map of the image
* Pooling Layer: reduces the dimensions of feature maps thereby reducing the computational complexity
* Flatten Layer: converts data into a 1-D array suitable for processing the output in the final layer
* Fully-Connected layer
* Output Layer
