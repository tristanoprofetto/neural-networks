# Deep Learning Implementations

The focus of this repository is to present the various types of Neural Network architectures and how to implement them in Python using TensorFlow and PyTorch, the most popular open source deep learning libraries today. 

Depending on the type data at hand (text, image, sound), several network architectures have been proposed by some of the greatest minds in the field of AI in order to properly fit a particular use case.

### Neural Network Architectures 
* **ANN's** (Artificial Neural Networks) are your plain vanilla network architecture.

* **RNN's** (Recurrent Neural Networks) are a special type of neural network architechture best suited to address text data for applications in NLP (natural language processing)   or recently in regression problems such as Time-Series dued to the sequential nature of the data.

* **CNN's** (Convolutional Neural Networks) are mainly used in the classification context particularly applied to images for building Computer Vision applications such as object detection, image segmentation ect.. 

* **GAN's** (Generative Adversial Networks) involve two models; a Generator and Discriminator, which oppose eachother in order for the Generator to create new data, based on the feedback learned from contesting the Discriminator.

* **Transformers** a novel type of neural network powered by the Encoder and Decoder that adopts the mechanism of attention, differentially indentifying the significance of each part of the input data... powerful applications in the field of natural language processing and computer vision are built with these 'state-of-the-art' architectures.
