# Style Generative Adversarial Network's (StyleGAN's)

StyleGAN is an extension to the GAN architecture that proposes large changes to the generator model:
* a mapping network to map points in latent space to an intermediate latent space
* intermediate latent space to control style at each point in the generator model
* introduction to noise as a source of variation at each point in the generator model.

The resulting model is capable not only of generating impressively photorealistic high-quality photos of faces, but also offers control over the style of the generated image at different levels of detail through varying the style vectors and noise.
