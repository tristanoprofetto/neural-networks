# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's)

GAN's are a special type of neural network optimized for computer vision tasks.

Components:
* Generator
* Discriminator


### Challenges when Evaluating GAN's
One aspect that makes evaluating GANs challenging is that the loss tells us little about their performance. Unlike with classifiers, where a low loss on a test set indicates superior performance, a low loss for the generator or discriminator suggests that learning has stopped.
