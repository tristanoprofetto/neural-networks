# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's)

Also known as **Vanilla** Neural Networks, ANN's are the simplest implementation of deep learning model architectures.

Inspired from the human brain, ANN's were first designed for the purpose of mimicing the way human brain operates in order to learn and solve problems.
