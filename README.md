# Deep Learning with TensorFlow
Using TensorFlow library to build deep learning models on various datasets composed of numbers, text, and images.

Depending on the type data at hand, several network architectures have been proposed by some of the greatest minds in the field of AI in order to properly fit a particular use case.


* **ANN's** (Artificial Neural Networks) are your plain vanilla network architecture.

* **RNN's** (Recurrent Neural Networks) are a special type of neural network architechture best suited to address text data for applications in NLP (natural language processing)   or recently in regression problems such as Time-Series dued to the sequential nature of the data.

* **CNN's** (Convolutional Neural Networks) are mainly used in the classification context particularly applied to images for building Computer Vision applciations.

* **GAN's** (Generative Adversial Networks) involve two models; a Generator and Discriminator which oppose eachother in order for the Generator to create
