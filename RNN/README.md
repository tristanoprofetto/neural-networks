# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)

### Architecture
RNN's are a special form of neural networks which leverage their "memory" property in order allow previous outputs to be used as sequential inputs throughout the hidden layers. This ability to process sequential data has allowed for serious advances in the field of AI, more specifically in NLP (natural language processing).

### Applications:
* Speech Recognition
* Stock Predictions
* Language Translation
* Sentiment Analysis


### How RNN's Learn
Thanks to the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm, RNN's can have their weights optimized in way of best handling sequential data such as; text and time-series.
