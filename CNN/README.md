# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's)

CNN's are a type of neural network architecture optimized for tackling Computer Vision tasks. 

The architecture of CNN's is designed to better handle image data, and since its inception has driven the AI driven applications over the last decade.

### CNN Architecture
There are several types of CNN architectures that are optimized for different computer vision tasks, but generally speaking they will contain the following layers...
* Input Layer
* Covolutional Layer
* Pooling Layer
* Flatten Layer
* Fully-Connected layer
* Output Layer
